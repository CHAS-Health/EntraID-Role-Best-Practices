# Overview
Defender Cloud App Security (Defender for Cloud, CASB, Defender Cloud App Security, etc) is a module that Microsoft offers which tracks which applications that people are using. This primarily tracks cloud applications, however, it will also give you the ability to uninstall applications on desktops if the cloud app is related to a desktop application. 

Defender Cloud app Security is now integrated with Microsoft XDR, in the Defender portal. This also includes the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC), although at the time of writing this is not as fleshed out as the other RBAC options that Defender XDR offers.

To get to the Cloud App roles, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to the "Permissions" tab in Defender XDR 
2. Under "Cloud Apps" (located at the bottom of the list), select "Roles"
